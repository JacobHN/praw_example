https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/vn0c9v/update_he_is_cheating_original_my_husband_told/Update: He is cheating. Original: My husband told someone he was out with his little sister. He doesn’t have one.I don’t know what happened to my original post but here’s the text:

      I’ve been married to my husband for a long time. We have kids, a house, and pets together. We have an active sex life, we go on dates often and share a lot of the same hobbies. 

      Today he’s at a pool party with our oldest son. I took our youngest to the water park in town where I ran into one of the other moms I know. We started talking and she mentioned at one point that it had been so nice to meet my husbands younger sister last week and asked if she was my sister or his. 

      I replied that neither one of us has a sister and asked her what the woman looked like, she said she was young and petite with dark hair. 

      I only have a much younger brother with red hair and he has a brother who is over 6ft so neither one of us have a sibling who could be confused for a sister. He doesn’t have any cousins and I do but he’s not close with any of them. 


      I’m freaking out because obviously the first thing my mind goes to is he’s cheating, I remember him going to the park last week and he never made any mention of meeting up with anyone or hanging out with anyone there. My youngest son isn’t old enough to tell me. I can’t get through to him because his phone isn’t on him since they’re in the pool. So now I’m just here freaking out because my mind is going wild.



When he got home from with our son I simply said, “Trish said she ran into you at the park. She said you were with someone you introduced as your sister. Who was it?”


I knew something was up because he was just silent and he didn’t say anything. Then he just said “Okay, we need to talk. Do you want to do this now or later?” Obviously I said now so he told the boys to go play downstairs. 

He admitted he had been planning on leaving me “for a while” but he had wanted to wait for the right time to do it. He said he had met someone else he had feelings for, he had met her last year and things happened slowly, he said he never cheated on me physically but there were a lot of times he told me he was doing work when he was really texting her or going into his office to FaceTime her and they would sometimes meet up. 

I asked him why he felt okay bringing our son around this person and he said it was because our son already knew her, which is when I found out that his “little sister” and person he’s leaving me for is our sons daycare teacher. My husband is the one who drops off every morning so I guess that’s how they met. I should’ve guessed something was up when he began volunteering to go pick him up as well.

He seemed apologetic and kept repeating that he never did anything physical, and that he wanted to remain civil for the kids. 


I still haven’t fully processed any of this. He’s living in the basement apartment until we get things figured out.https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/vmtrvh/my_27m_girlfriend_27f_posted_an_old_photo_of_her/My (27m) girlfriend (27f) posted an old photo of her and her ex, after we got into an argumentWe’ve been together for two years. Yesterday we got into an argument over something silly. Then she posted a picture of her and her ex boyfriend on her Instagram story, with the words “if I could do it all over again I would lol”. I confronted her about it, and she said she was referring to her “college days”. I guess that could be the reason behind it because the photo was of them at a party, but she could’ve chosen a different photo.https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/vmwkgn/my_fiancé_is_trying_to_covertly_build_a_case_to/My fiancé is trying to covertly build a case to steal our baby from meI have 2 kids from a previous relationship who are at their bio fathers for a month. This is obviously a tough month for me, I miss them fiercely and have admittedly been pretty depressed. I still try to power through for my 11 month old baby.

I work 4-2am. Sun-Fri. My fiancé works 9-5p. I get a babysitter for our baby (and the big kids when they’re home) and pay for it myself for the overlap, find backup and emergency sitters. I do it without his help which is stressful, and just an example of one of the things that I carry 100% of the emotional weight.

Since I work late, and baby gets up at 8am, I need a nap to be able to function. Trying not to nap has lead to health issues after a prolonged period of time, including a heart issue. I try to nap with the baby at around 11-12 until 1ish. 

The other day I wasn’t feeling well. I had bad allergies so took Benadryl after my shift at 2am. I obviously wasn’t very awake and put baby in her pack and play while I kind of lied half awake after my fiancé left. I dosed off but would wake up if the baby made any noise. At 11 I fed and changed her, and brought her to nap. Then got up, fed and changed her again, then went to work. She had diarrhea from changing her formula (thank you shortage) and it caused a little rash. My fiancé accused me of neglecting the baby. He then called my only support system and told them exaggerated versions.

We came to an agreement that I wouldn’t lay down until the baby was napping. Just in case. I’d force myself to stay awake from 8a-11ish. No laying on the couch or anything. So I did that.

Today I have off randomly. I still got up at 8, played with the baby, cleaned some of the house that has been neglected because of my depression. Then fed her and changed her at 11. We both went to nap at 11:30.

Apparently my fiancé tried to call me at 1:30 and I didn’t hear my phone. Baby slept until after 2. She wasn’t even fussing yet when I got up and got her up at 2:30. He thinks I’m lying. I have no reason to lie. It’s what happened. Now he’s saying that he’s going to take me to court…https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/vmwkgn/my_fiancé_is_trying_to_covertly_build_a_case_to/My fiancé is trying to covertly build a case to steal our baby from meI have 2 kids from a previous relationship who are at their bio fathers for a month.

Hello everyone. Thank you for all of the words of advice and different perspectives on my situation. The unanimous consensus seemed to be to talk to my husband again, and set boundaries. 

I sat down and had another talk with him. I told him I wasn’t accusing him of anything and laid out exactly how everything had made me feel. He seemed genuinely sorry that I felt that way, and said he was happy that I talked to him about it all and was open about it. But he said that he didn’t understand. He said that if I was secure in our relationship, and his loyalty and monogamy, and that if I trusted her, he didn’t understand why I was upset about these things. 

I tried to ask him if he would feel like it wasn’t a big deal if the roles were reversed, and it was a male friend who I was getting close to like that. He said that if there was a male and he knew the feelings were completely platonic he would be fine with it. But he said that he respected that I wasn’t, and that he was going to be more aware around her, he said he didn’t think it was fair to cut  her off or stop inviting her over or having her watch the boys and I did agree. 

I’m glad that he respected my boundaries and heard me out, I do wish he had understood where I was coming from a bit better though. Either way, thanks for the advice to talk to him again. I’m happy i was clear about how it all made me feel and he knows now. 


**Part 2**

I wrote the above update, and was going to post it but then we had a fight which I think is worth bringing up here. There were so many people talking about the hoodie. So I went to go get it, and I washed it. When I was folding the laundry, my husband came in and saw that I had washed it and definitely seemed a little annoyed-he kind of sighed, rolled his eyes and shook his head. I didn’t say anything though. Later on as he was putting everything away into his closet he held up the hoodie and was like, “I told you that you didn’t have to wash it, if you’re so sure I’m going to cheat on you why does it matter what my hoodie smells like?” and then he took it and threw it onto floor of his closet instead of hanging it up with the rest of them. 

I told him I didn’t think he was going to cheat on me, but I didn’t like his clothing smelling overpoweringly like another woman, he said it hadn’t  smelled overpoweringly like her she had just already washed it so it smelled like her fabric softener. He said I was harping on this and that I was behaving ridiculously, etc. I told him that all I had done was wash a hoodie, which was the same thing I would’ve done if one of our kids clothes came back from a friends house. 

Today after he got dressed his closet door was open and I saw the hoodie wasn’t on the floor anymore, but it wasn’t with his other sweatshirts either. I asked him where it was, and he didn’t answer, he just said (really low, to himself) “You’ve got to be kidding me, here we go again.” I told him that I wasn’t trying to start anything, it had been on the floor and now it wasn’t so if it needed to be cleaned again or ironed I would. 

He turned around, told me to “Let go of the f**king hoodie, I’m not talking about it again.”

I was completely shocked because he never talked to me like that before, especially not in front of our kids. He didn’t even apologize, he just left for work and slammed the door. I really didn’t mean to make such a big deal about the hoodie, I kind of feel like he’s making a big deal about me washing it, right?
