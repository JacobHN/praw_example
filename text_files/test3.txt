We’ve had some issues  about me going out and being more social for a year. I was diagnosed with depression 3 years ago and he has bipolar and OCD. My depression was triggered by my work which involves video news. I gained like 15 kgs and my self-confidence and esteem took a huge blow so I became antisocial but my husband never made me feel like I was not beautiful. Recently we worked hard on fixing our relationship and we are in a great place now. We both really love each other. My husband very recently told me he has downloaded social dating apps in the past and used then to sext people as a “fetish” and to feel less lonely, for him it was like watching “porn”. I took this news pretty harsh and I am hurt, but I’m trying to understand. He apologised and promised he’s not interested in doing that again and he was feeling alone when he did that. I am willing to get past this but I don’t know what to do. I was blindsided as I never felt our relationship was as bad as it was for him. I’m not sure what to do. I appreciate him telling me and being remorseful over this but I wanna trust that this won’t happen again. How do I proceed?
